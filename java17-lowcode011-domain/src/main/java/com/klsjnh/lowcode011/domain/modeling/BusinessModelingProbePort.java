/**
 * Take-out SQL probe port: runs a read-only statement against the datasource
 * identified by dsCode and reports both the column metadata and a row sample,
 * so the management view can preview the fields a modeling would produce
 * before anything is persisted.
 * <p>
 * The port exists separately from {@code SqlRoutingPort} because a plain select
 * returns only column-value maps and drops the type metadata, which is exactly
 * what the inference needs. The implementation still runs the same statement
 * over the same pool — it merely reads {@code ResultSetMetaData} alongside the
 * rows.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A probe NEVER throws on an unreachable target or a broken statement: it
 * reports {@link ProbeOutcome#fail(String)}. Only programming errors propagate.
 * </p>
